"""Abstractions for reasoning about tool state within Galaxy workflows.

Like everything else in galaxy-tool-util, this package should be independent of
Galaxy's runtime. It is meant to provide utilities for reasonsing about tool state
(largely building on the abstractions in galaxy.tool_util.parameters) within the
context of workflows.
